# Diabetes-Analysis
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) of the Pima Tribe to draw key insights into Diabetes from a controlled sample population. Was able to recognize a skew in age that needs to be taken into account when drawing insights from the data. Found high correlation rates between:
* SkinThickness and BMI (0.53)
* Glucose and Insulin (0.40)
* Age and BloodPressure (0.33)

And a surprisingly low corelation between Insulin and Blood Pressure (0.01)
